    <h4> About Me</h4><br>
<p class="justify">My name is Sean Titesor a Sophmore at Brigham Young University. I am 21 years old and grew up in Utah. I lived abraod for that last 2 years in Korea as  a Missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was so fun I got to learn Korean as I served others and taught people how the Gospel of Jesus Christ can bring happiness and meaning into their lives. I am currently studying Applied Physics. Math and science has been my passion ever since I was in middle school and I am happy to be able to study how the world works. I hope to one day become an engineer and create a product that will change the world for the better! I also love spedning time in nature: hiking, fishing, backpacking, biking, and camping are some of my favorite things! I also love sports especially soccer and basketball. I also love to read books, I am currently reading A sci-fi series by Brandon Sanderson, and a book called Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.
